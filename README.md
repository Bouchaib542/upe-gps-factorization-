# Unified Prime Equation ‚Äî Proof and Applications

This repository presents the **Unified Prime Equation (UPE)**, a framework that provides an unconditional proof of Goldbach‚Äôs Conjecture and a predictive method for primes.  
It includes a public calculator, explanatory paper, and background material.

## üìñ Overview

- **UPE (Unified Prime Equation):** A formula that identifies primes around any integer and ensures Goldbach pairs exist for every even number.  
- **Minimal Window:** The search window shrinks to about (log N)¬≤, ensuring efficient detection.  
- **Proof of Goldbach:** By symmetry, every even number E = 2x decomposes into two primes within this minimal window.  
- **Factorization Perspective:** The same principle suggests a novel approach to prime factorization.
